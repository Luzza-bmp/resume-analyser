    # __name__ is a special Python variable that tells Flask where this code is located.

# If the file is run directly, __name__ is "__main__"
# only for __init__.py: If it is imported from another module, __name__ is the module name, like "app". app.py importing from app/__init__.py will have __name__ of __init__.py as "app"

    # .config is an attribute of the Flask application instance that holds the configuration settings for the application.
    # # it is a dictionary-like object that allows you to store and access various configuration values that your application may need, such as database connection strings, secret keys, and other settings.
    # The from_object method is used to load configuration settings from a specified object, in this case, "app.config.Config". It reads all attributes from that object and copies them into app.config.

# init_app s designed to give each extension only the config it needs, not everything.

    # init_app reads app.config and prepares the SQLAlchemy extension to work with the Flask application. It sets up the necessary configurations and connections to the database based on the settings defined in app.config.
